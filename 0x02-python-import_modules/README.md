# Python - import & modules

From this task I got an understanding of:
	Why python programming is awesome
	How to import functions from another file
	How to use imported functions
	How to create a module
	How to use the built-in -function dir()
	How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
	How to use command line arguments with your python programs

1. A program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some
	Maths, and prints the result.
2. A program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
3. A program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments
4. A program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module
